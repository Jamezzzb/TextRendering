# TextRendering
I have rewrote (+ some slight modifications) part of code objC -> Swift from 'Metal by Example' written by Warren Moore. 
1) The related objC code is here: https://github.com/metal-by-example/sample-code/tree/master/objc/12-TextRendering
2) The article with some details on the technique is here https://metalbyexample.com/rendering-text-in-metal-with-signed-distance-fields/
